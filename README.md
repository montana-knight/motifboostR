# motifboostR
This R package utilizes an XGBoost algorithm to find motifs important for gene response classification and rank candidate promoter regions based on their motif composition and log odds probability prediction.

The input for this package is a csv file filled with motif counts and corresponding binary gene responses.

The output is information about important motifs linked to each gene response and which regions may be good candidate promoters for further validation.
