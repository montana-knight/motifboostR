Description: Welcome to motifboostR. This package utilizes the XGBoost machine learning algorithm to link motifs to a corresponding gene expression pattern. Information on motif composition in each regulatory region is then extracted and used to prioritize regulatory regions as candidate promoters associated with that gene expression pattern.
